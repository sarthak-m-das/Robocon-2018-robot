This is a fully automated bot which will be throwing shuttlecocks from rings placed at some height. The arena will have two zones. It will consist of two rings one at each zone, in opposite directions.
The bot will traverse to the first zone and throw the shuttle. Then it will move to the next zone and make a complete 360 degree rotation to throw the shuttle from the second ring.
